# map-app
HackUPC Project 2018

## Description

Map-app (name in progress) is a social platform to find out about events near your current location. Any user of the app can place a pin on the map indicating some activity they'd like to do (Play tennis), and every other user can see that event.



## Setup

1. Make a directory for your hackUPC project -- `mkdir hackUPC`
2. Pull the code -- `git clone https://github.com/joshspicer/map-app.git`
3. Run `yarn`, which will install all the project dependencies (specified in package.json) into a folder called `node_modules`
4. Connect your device or start your Android emulator
5. Run `yarn run android`, and the app should attach to your Android device.
6. Show Josh the error and he'll hopefully know what to do
